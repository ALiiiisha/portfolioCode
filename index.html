        born December 25, 1876, Karachi, India [now in Pakistan]—died September

      <h2 class="heading">Early Life</h2>
      <p class="content">
        Born on <strong>December 25,1876 </strong> in
        <strong> Karachi</strong> and educated at the<strong
          >Sindh Madrassat-ul-Islam </strong
        >Jinnah joined the <strong>Lincon'Inn</strong> in 1893 to become the
        youngest Indian to be called to the Bar, three years later. . Once he
        was firmly established in the legal profession, Jinnah formally entered
        politics in 1905 from the platform of the
        <strong>Indian National Congress.</strong>
      </p>
      <h2 class="heading">Political Career</h2>
      <p class="content">
        Three years later, in January 1910, Jinnah was elected to the
        newly-constituted Imperial Legislative Council. he was probably the most
        powerful voice in the cause of Indian freedom and Indian rights. Jinnah,
        who was also the first Indian to pilot a private member's Bill through
        the Council, soon became a leader of a group inside the legislature. Mr.
        Montagu (1879-1924), Secretary of State for India, at the close of the
        First World War, considered Jinnah
        <strong
          >"perfect mannered, impressive-looking, armed to the teeth with
          dialectics..."Jinnah, he felt, "is a very clever man, and it is, of
          course, an outrage that such a man should have no chance of running
          the affairs of his own country."</strong
        >
      </p>
      <h2 class="heading">Constitutional Struggle</h2>
      <p class="content">
        In the ever-growing frustration among the masses caused by colonial
        rule, there was ample cause for extremism. But, Gandhi's doctrine of
        non-cooperation, Jinnah felt, even as Rabindranath Tagore(1861-1941) did
        also feel, was at best one of negation and despair: it might lead to the
        building up of resentment, but nothing constructive. Hence, he opposed
        tooth and nail the tactics adopted by Gandhi to exploit the
        <strong>Khilafat</strong>and wrongful tactics in the Punjab in the early
        twenties. On the eve of its adoption of the Gandhian programmed, Jinnah
        warned the Nagpur Congress Session (1920):
        <strong
          >"you are making a declaration (of Swaraj within a year) and
          committing the Indian National Congress to a programme, which you will
          not be able to carry out". He felt that there was no short-cut to
          independence and that any extra-constitutional methods could only lead
          to political violence, lawlessness and chaos, without bringing India
          nearer to the threshold of freom.</strong

      <h2 class="heading">The New Awakening</h2>
      <p class="content">
        As a result of Jinnah's ceaseless efforts, the Muslims awakened from
        what Professor Baker calls (their)<strong
          >"unreflective silence"
        </strong>
        (in which they had so complacently basked for long decades), and
        to<srong> "the spiritual essence of nationality"</srong> that had
        existed among them for a pretty long time. Roused by the impact of
        successive Congress hammerings, the Muslims, as Ambedkar (principal
        author of independent India's Constitution) says,<strong>
          "searched their social consciousness in a desperate attempt to find
          coherent and meaningful articulation to their cherished yearnings. To
          their great relief, they discovered that their sentiments of
          nationality had flamed into nationalism".</strong

      <h2 class="heading">Demand for Pakistan</h2>
      <p class="content">
        <strong>"We are a nation",</strong> they claimed in the ever eloquent
        words of the Quaid-i-Azam- "We are a nation with our own distinctive
        culture and civilization, language and literature, art and architecture,
        names and nomenclature, sense of values and proportion, legal laws and
        moral code, customs and calendar, history and tradition, aptitudes and
        ambitions; in short, we have our own distinctive outlook on life and of
        life. By all canons of international law, we are a nation". The
        formulation of the Muslim demand for Pakistan in 1940 had a tremendous
        impact on the nature and course of Indian politics. On the one hand, it
        shattered for ever the Hindu dreams of a pseudo-Indian, in fact, Hindu
        empire on British exit from India: on the other, it heralded an era of
        Islamic renaissance and creativity in which the Indian Muslims were to
        be active participants. The Hindu reaction was quick, bitter, and
        malicious.

      <h2 class="heading">Leader of Free Nation</h2>
      <p class="content">
        His very presence at the helm of affairs was responsible for enabling
        the newly born nation to overcome the terrible crisis on the morrow of
        its cataclysmic birth. Though tired and in poor health, Jinnah yet
        carried the heaviest part of the burden in that first crucial year. He
        laid down the policies of the new state, called attention to the
        immediate problems confronting the nation and told the members of the
        Constituent Assembly, the civil servants and the Armed Forces what to do
        and what the nation expected of them. He saw to it that law and order
        was maintained at all costs, despite the provocation that the
        large-scale riots in north India had provided. He moved from Karachi to
        Lahore for a while and supervised the immediate refugee problem in the
        Punjab. In a time of fierce excitement, he remained sober, cool and
        steady. He advised his excited audience in Lahore to concentrate on
        helping the refugees, to avoid retaliation, exercise restraint and
        protect the minorities. He assured the minorities of a fair deal,
        assuaged their inured sentiments, and gave them hope and comfort.
      </p>
      <h2 class="heading">Quaid's Last Message</h2>
      <p class="content">
        Jinnah told the nation in his last message on 14 August, 1948:<strong
          >"The foundations of your State have been laid and it is now for you
          to build and build as quickly and as well as you can". In
          accomplishing the task he had taken upon himself on the morrow of
          Pakistan's birth, Jinnah had worked himself to death, but he had, to
          quote Richard Symons, "contributed more than any other man to
          Pakistan's survival".
        </strong>
        He died on 11 September, 1948. A man such as Jinnah, who had fought for
        the inherent rights of his people all through his life and who had taken
        up the somewhat unconventional and the largely misinterpreted cause of
        Pakistan, was bound to generate violent opposition and excite implacable
        hostility and was likely to be largely misunderstood. But what is most
        remarkable about Jinnah is that he was the recipient of some of the
        greatest tributes paid to any one in modern times, some of them even
        from those who held a diametrically opposed viewpoint.

      <h2 class="heading">People opinions about Quaid</h2>
      <p class="content">
        <strong> The Aga Khan</strong>
        considered him the greatest man he ever met",
        <strong>Beverley Nichols</strong> , the author of `Verdict on India',
        called him "the most important man in Asia", and
        <strong> Dr. Kailashnath Katju</strong> , the West Bengal Governor in
        1948, thought of him as "an outstanding figure of this century not only
        in India, but in the whole world". While
        <strong>Abdul Rahman Azzam Pasha</strong> , Secretary General of the
        Arab League, called him "one of the greatest leaders in the Muslim
        world", the<strong> Grand Mufti of Palestine</strong> considered his
        death as a "great loss" to the entire world of Islam.
